                <p  className={styles.content}>I am a designer with many years of experience in conceptual, functional and visual work. For me, design is a process - based on analysis, a sense of proportion, function and aesthetics. I have worked on many complex projects that required combining creativity with logical thinking, attention to detail and understanding of user needs. I am currently developing towards designing user interfaces, wanting to transfer my experience to the digital environment. I am interested in designing visual systems that are not only aesthetic, but above all legible and intuitive.</p>
                <h6>When it comes to design, I am close to the principle of less is more â€“ I value simplicity, clarity and function supported by aesthetics.</h6>
                <h5>I believe that design is an experience, regardless of scale.</h5>
